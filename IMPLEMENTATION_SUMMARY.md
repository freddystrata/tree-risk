# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Risk Dashboard

### 1. New Financial Impact Formula

**Formula**: `Financial Impact = (Dollar Effect per Unit) × (Exposure Units) × (Probability/5)`

**Changes Made**:
- **Updated `src/types/risk.ts`**: Added new fields to RiskItem interface:
  - `dollarEffectPerUnit`: Cost per unit (e.g., $10,000/day, $500/MWh)
  - `exposureUnits`: Number of units affected (e.g., 20 days, 100 MWh, 10% tariff)
  - `exposureUnitType`: Type of exposure unit (e.g., "days", "MWh", "% tariff")
  - `financialImpact`: Calculated financial impact using the new formula
  - `mitigationSavings`: Calculated savings from mitigation
  - `riskType`: Type for cause-effect diagram ('root_cause' | 'intermediate' | 'effect')

- **Updated `src/utils/riskCalculations.ts`**: Added new calculation functions:
  - `calculateFinancialImpact()`: Implements the new formula
  - `calculateMitigationSavings()`: Calculates Original Impact - Residual Impact
  - Updated `createRiskItem()` to use new calculations

- **Updated `src/data/sampleRisks.ts`**: Added example data with new formula:
  - Delay in interconnection: $15,000/day × 20 days × 0.8 probability = $240,000
  - Module price tariff: $10,000/% × 10% × 0.6 probability = $60,000
  - Regulatory penalty: $250,000 × 1 occurrence × 0.2 probability = $50,000

### 2. Line Chart for Risk & Financial Impact Trends

**Changes Made**:
- **Updated `src/components/ProjectAnalytics.tsx`**: 
  - Replaced bar chart with SVG line chart
  - Shows 12-month risk trend data
  - Displays two lines: Risk Impact Trend (blue) and Mitigation Savings (green)
  - Uses actual project risk data for calculations
  - Added interactive data points with hover effects

### 3. Simplified Cause-Effect Diagram

**Changes Made**:
- **Completely rewrote `src/components/CauseEffectTree.tsx`**:
  - Replaced complex fishbone diagram with simple cause-effect flow
  - Three layers: Root Causes → Intermediate Risks → Final Effect
  - Clear arrows pointing from causes to effects
  - Color-coded nodes: Red (Root Cause), Orange (Risk Event), Green (Final Impact)
  - Structured like the user's example with proper convergence to main effect

### 4. Enhanced Excel Export Structure

**Changes Made**:
- Updated risk categorization to include all three levels:
  - Root Cause / Risk Event / Final Impact labels
  - Matched with appropriate mitigation strategies
  - Clear type identification in export data

### 5. Simplified Risk Assessment Matrix

**Changes Made**:
- **Updated `src/components/RiskGuide.tsx`**:
  - Removed duplicate probability/impact keys
  - Removed unnecessary columns (STATUS, REALIZED, RATING_NC, RATING_NAME)
  - Simplified to show only the core risk matrix
  - Added probability/impact labels directly in headers
  - Only colored the matrix entries, not the headers
  - Added comprehensive Financial Impact Formula section with examples

### 6. Updated Financial Calculations

**Changes Made**:
- **Updated `src/components/ProjectAnalytics.tsx`**:
  - Uses new financial impact calculations throughout
  - Displays actual calculated financial impacts and mitigation savings
  - Shows potential savings from risk mitigation
  - Improved financial metrics display

## Example Financial Impact Calculations

| Risk | Effect | Value/Unit | Exposure | Probability | Impact |
|------|--------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Delay in interconnection | $/day revenue loss | $15,000/day | 20 days | 0.8 (4/5) | $240,000 |
| Module price tariff | % price increase | $10K/% | 10% | 0.6 (3/5) | $60,000 |
| Regulatory penalty | Flat cost | $250,000 | 1 | 0.2 (1/5) | $50,000 |

## Mitigation Savings Example

- **Original Expected Impact**: $240,000
- **After 80% mitigation**: $48,000 (20% remaining)
- **Savings**: $192,000

This helps justify the cost of risk controls and mitigation strategies.

## Key Features Added

1. **New Financial Impact Formula**: More accurate cost calculations based on actual exposure
2. **Line Chart Visualization**: Better trend analysis over time
3. **Simplified Cause-Effect Diagram**: Clear causal relationships with proper arrow flow
4. **Streamlined Risk Matrix**: Focused on essential information only
5. **Enhanced Financial Reporting**: Better visibility into cost impacts and savings
